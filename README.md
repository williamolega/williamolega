# ⚡William Olega: Cybersecurity Portfolio  
*A collection of labs, hunts, and infrastructure projects from a curious mind focused on understanding how security really works.*

**I learn by doing.**

This portfolio is where I build systems, investigate behavior, harden environments, and turn complexity into clarity.  
It reflects how I think about security: calmly, structurally, and with long-term impact in mind.

## 🎯 What This Portfolio Represents

- Hands-on security intuition (not just theory)
- End-to-end thinking: infrastructure → identity → detection
- Clear documentation and explainable decisions
- Continuous growth through intentional projects

> *North Star:* Become a calm, trusted security advisor with deep technical credibility.

## 🏗️ Enterprise Infrastructure & Identity

### 🔹 **Enterprise Active Directory Network Infrastructure Lab**  
*Windows Server 2022 | Windows 11 | VMware*

- AD domain design with integrated DNS  
- Secure internal network segmentation  
- Domain-joined client configuration  
- Identity-focused audit and logging setup  
- Designed as a foundation for future security tooling
